# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a javascript method that takes any number of inputs and may/ or may not return some value back to the caller.

  Researched answer:A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task



2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer: .map traverses through an array and returns and array of the same size, .filter goes through each element of an array and returns a subset of the original array.

  Researched answer: . filter() returns a subset of the elements from the original array, while . map() produces an array with new, different entries based on the elements in the original array.



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log() outputs/logs some data to the computer output terminal, where as "return" just returns a value from a function to a calling piece of code.

  Researched answer: Return is used to interrupt the flow of execution of a function and return some value (or not). console. log is used to print information to the console



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: An argument is a values that is given to the function in the parameter list so that the function can use the data to either manipulate, modify, or calculate some responding data.

  Researched answer: The parameters, in a function call, are the function's arguments. JavaScript arguments are passed by value: The function only gets to know the values, not the argument's locations. If a function changes an argument's value, it does not change the parameter's original value.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: The "driver" has the responsibility of writing the code, the "navigator" is responsible for defining the requirements and reviewing the code as it is being written.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.



6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: "TDD" is Test Driven Development.  This is where the developer writes the tests before any actual functional code is developed.  Work flow = Write test, write code, run test, modify, success.

  Researched answer: TDD is an evolutionary approach to development which combines test-first development where you write a test before you write just enough production code to fulfill that test and refactoring



7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Pair programming is very useful because it gives my brain a break, plus we each come up with different ideas, thus yielding more was to solve a problem.  TDD helps me to think functionally through a problem, making it easier to code the concept.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React: React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers

- Yarn: Yarn is a new package manager that replaces the existing workflow for the npm client or other package managers while remaining compatible with the npm registry. It has the same feature set as existing workflows while operating faster, more securely, and more reliably

- React State: React components has a built-in state object. The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.

- CRUD: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) are the four basic functions that models should be able to do, at most

- this: The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to. ... In a function, this refers to the global object. In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined . In an event, this refers to the element that received the event. Methods like call() , and apply() can refer this to any object.
